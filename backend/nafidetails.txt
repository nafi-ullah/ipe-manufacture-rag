AboutAbout
I am a dedicated and energetic software developer with a diverse skill set. My expertise covers a range of areas, including Cloud Technology, mobile app and web development, as well as backend and database management.

As a Cloud Technology enthusiast, I specialize in containerizing projects with Docker and deploying them on AWS through CI/CD systems. In the realm of web development, I've successfully executed projects using Next.js, React.js, and JavaScript, and I also possess hands-on experience with Flutter.

My backend proficiency extends to Node.js and Spring Boot, where I focus on ensuring the reliability and performance of web applications. Additionally, I have extensive experience working with both SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Firebase).

Adaptable to various environments and technical requirements, I am comfortable working on both Windows and Linux platforms.

This time, the hackathon was not only for students but also for industry professionals and was open to everyone. We had an amazing experience competing with industry engineers on the topic of AI-based applications.
Alhamdulillah, we became the runners-up in the Vivasoft Limited AI Hackathon. 

We developed an AI-powered Market Analysis Platform to validate ideas against market trends.
It was really challenging to create such a platform, packed with features, interactivity, and diversity, within just 24 hours. However, it became possible thanks to the incredible efforts of 
Ovishek Paul vai , who led the team from the front; the amazing Sourav Sarker Suvra Vai; AI engineer Shawon Majid Vai; and our seamless collaboration as a team.

Though I started my development journey on GitHub in 2023, 2024 has been a truly transformative year for me. I participated in multiple competitions and worked on several personal projects. After starting a remote job, most of my contributions became private or on other branches from May onwards. Nevertheless, there has been a significant improvement in my GitHub contributions from 2023 to 2024. Looking forward to making 2025 a year for focusing on LeetCode alongside GitHub.

I began my hackathon journey with the 2022 LUCC Hackathon, and today, I have participated for the third time. Alhamdulillah, this time, we emerged as champions 🏆 ! A heartfelt thanks to my teammates 
Shahiduzzaman Bipul and Unayes Ahmed Khan , who tirelessly worked on perfecting the software throughout the intense 24-hour competition.

We developed a platform featuring both mobile and web applications, based on the problem statement and software requirements provided by the judges.

🚀 I'm glad to share that our team Team_Oracle was a finalist of the Cisco IoT hackathon 2024. ✨
It's been an incredible journey of collaboration, innovation and dedication. This opportunity has pushed us to think beyond the conventional and develop IoT solutions that can truly make a difference. 

So, the idea of our project was about to help our senior citizens to reduce their health risks. Considering the fact that there is an increase in the world's elderly every single day, it is important to provide care for the majority of elderly people in their old age, especially if they live alone. 

➡️ Problem Statement: 
Sick elderly persons, especially living alone (e.g. with the risk of heart attacks, brain strokes or sudden falls) who are most in need of immediate medical assistance. But living alone prevents timely alerts to family members, compromising their lives. Besides, they often forget to take their medicines on time, may take wrong medicines due to lack of understanding of the prescription. 

➡️ Proposed Solution:
Our AI_Venerable_Sentinel is a product that uses IoT, AI and Machine Learning technologies to manage the daily routine of old people in real-time. Our solution consists of:
1. A monitoring system that is able to tell if a person is feeling fear through body language and the way they move.
2. Intelligent medicine box alerts you for intake of pills on time, opens and closes the specific medication box and sends information to their caregivers via mobile app. When it is time to take the medicine the database API is called. The database is updated and through socket connection the specific box containing specific medicine is opened. 
3. Also, a system that can analyse prescriptions and medical test reports just by taking pictures. The mobile app is linked with the smart medicine box to open the box according to the time written in prescription. Besides, the caregivers can set alerm to take the meal on time so that the medicine box can collaborate with it and open at proper time.

➡️ Our Project's Features:
1. Real-time Patient's Abnormality Detection and Instant Notification.
2. Prescription and Report Analysis
3. Smart Medication management

➡️ Technological Stack:
1. Mobile App - hashtag#Flutter and hashtag#Dart.
2. Machine Learning Backend - hashtag#Flask, hashtag#Media_Pipe hashtag#OpenCV and hashtag#Python.
3. Mobile App Backend - hashtag#NodeJS, hashtag#GPT_4 API, hashtag#JavaScript, hashtag#MongoDB, hashtag#ExpressJS and hashtag#Web_Socket.
4. Hosting - hashtag#AWS and hashtag#Docker.
5. IoT Device - hashtag#Web_Camera, hashtag#ESP32, hashtag#arduino, hashtag#Servo_Motors, hashtag#Power_Supply and hashtag#Buck_Module. 

👉 Take a look at a quick demo of our project "AI_Venerable_Sentinel"

After becoming the Champion in the biggest inter-university hackathon "Code Samurai BD 2024", we had the honor of attending a victory celebration at the residence of the Japanese Ambassador, Mr. Iwama. The evening was filled with inspiring conversations, as we shared our successful project and career perspectives in Japan.
We are deeply grateful for the Ambassador's warm hospitality and the wonderful meal arranged for us. Special thanks to the Embassy of Japan and BJIT for their exceptional arrangements, including transportation and accommodation as the champion team. It was truly a memorable experience!

Thrilled to share that our team recently participated in the DevOps Hackathon presented by PORIDHI.IO - Powered By Brain Station 23. 🌐 Despite being students and newcomers to the field, we're overjoyed to announce that, Alhumdulillah, we emerged as "finalists" among seasoned professional teams!

🛠️ Task at Hand:
Our challenge was to construct a three-tier application integrated with tracing and matrices using OpenTelemetry for selected APIs. The goal was to enable remote monitoring through Jaeger and Grafana.

👩‍💻 Shawon Majid vai and Md. Mehrajul Islam vai had brilliant approach to conquering the desired application and building the system. Our Approach is:

Dividing our tasks, we built a robust three-tier application comprising Service1 (Node.js), Service2 (Node.js), and the database (MongoDB, MySQL), along with cache management using Redis. We successfully traced API calls, established matrices between Service1 and Service2, and visualized the traces in Jaeger while monitoring matrices through Prometheus on Grafana.

🐳 My Contribution:
I took charge of containerizing the entire microservices application using Docker and deployed the system on AWS.

🚀 Key Achievements:
🏆 Finalists despite being beginners.
🌐 Successfully built and deployed a three-tier application.
🔍 Traced API calls and monitored matrices remotely using Jaeger and Grafana.
🐳 Containerized the microservices application for seamless deployment on AWS.

Our team took part in a day-long Hackathon challenge where we developed a software application with artificial intelligence capabilities. 
 We managed to develop a mvp web app that can turn text into reels video. 🎥 

Alhumdulillah, We secured the 2nd position. 🎖 🥈 

My role was to get data from backend and create animation video, create webpages using the tech hashtag#remotion hashtag#nextjs hashtag#react hashtag#typescript . 💻 

It was a tough task to create such a product that could fetch and combine images, texts, and audioes to produce a video with amazing animation. 
 But we overcame the challenge with the strong team work with my respected seniors Shawon Majid vai and Md. Mehrajul Islam vai.

Our team, “Proshphut”, achieved the runners-up position in the NASA Space Apps Challenge in Bangladesh. 
We dedicated a month to rigorous preparation, with the final 72 hours being particularly intense as we forewent sleep. Our perseverance and dedication were rewarded with this achievement.

Introducing my Arduino project: The Broom Alarm Clock! 🧹🧹🔔 When the alarm goes off, there's no snooze button - just a friendly wake-up call from a motorized broom. 😄 A fun twist on waking up in the morning!
